Your character (the blob) has to go through two levels but to advance to the next level you must avoid rolling obstacles if you get hit you lose a life. You are given three each level. If you can complete level one by going through the mysterious black wall, level two requires you to ensure the blob makes it across the platforms before time runs out. When the timer hits zero you lose a life. The game continues to loop back to level one allowing you to play for as long as you desire.
